The meshes in meshes_Mujoco200/006_mustard_bottle are generated from  .obj in meshes_src/006_mustard_bottle (textured1.obj, textured2.obj, textured_simple.obj.)

The textured_simple.obj is the source from the YCB dataset. The other two(textured1.obj, textured2.obj) are generated by cutting the source textured.obj manully in MeshLab. 

The meshes in meshes_Mujoco200/011_banana are generated from  .obj in meshes_src/011_banana (textured1.obj.)

The textures used in Mojoco200 are flip of the textures used in MeshLab.
